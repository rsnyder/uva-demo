<p>
The Amalfi Coast (Italian: Costiera amalfitana) is a stretch of coastline in southern Italy 
overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Salerno. It is located south of the Sorrentine 
Peninsula and north of the Cilentan Coast.
</p>

<p>
Celebrated worldwide for its Mediterranean landscape and natural diversity, the Coast is named 
after the town of Amalfi, which makes up its main historical and political centre. It is a very 
popular jet set destination, and has been an attraction to upper-class Europeans since the 18th 
century, when it was a frequent stopover on their Grand Tours.
</p>

<p>
Attracting international tourists of all classes annually, the Amalfi Coast was listed as a
UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. Atrani and Vietri sul Mare are members of the I Borghi 
più belli d'Italia ("The most beautiful villages of Italy") association.
