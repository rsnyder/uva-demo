# Juncture (initial version)

The Plant Humanities Lab is a web site hosting visual essays that "Explore the cultural histories of plants and their influence on human societies".  The Plant Humanities Lab was launched in 2021 as a key output of 2 Mellon funded projects jointly conducted by Dumbarton Oaks and JSTOR Labs.

The infrastructure for the Plant Humanities Lab enables non-programmers to generate a rich web site consisting of multiple interactive visual essays.

A generalized version of the visual essay rendering code developed for the Plant Humanities Lab was released at the conclusion of the projects under the Juncture name.

## Key technologies used in Juncture

A guiding principle in the development of the Plant Humanities Lab (and the subsequent evolution of Juncture) was use of free and/or open-source tools where possible in a minimal computing environment. 

### Github

GitHub, Inc. is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control.  It provides distributed version control plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.  Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

Github is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 372 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is easy to read in its source code form.Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

### Wikidata

Wikidata is a collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation.It is a common source of open data that Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, and anyone else, can use under the CC0 public domain license. Wikidata is a wiki powered by the software MediaWiki, including its extension for semi-structured data, the Wikibase.

### International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF, spoken as 'triple-I-eff') defines several application programming interfaces that provide a standardised method of describing and delivering images over the web, as well as "presentation based metadata" (that is, structural metadata) about structured sequences of images. If institutions holding artworks, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials provide IIIF endpoints for their content, any IIIF-compliant viewer or application can consume and display both the images and their structural and presentation metadata.

### Leaflet

Leaflet is an open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. First released in 2011, it supports most mobile and desktop platforms, supporting HTML5 and CSS3. Among its users are FourSquare, Pinterest and Flickr.

Leaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display tiled web maps hosted on a public server, with optional tiled overlays. It can load feature data from GeoJSON files, style it and create interactive layers, such as markers with popups when clicked.

Leaflet was developed and is maintained by Volodymyr Agafonkin, a software engineer living in Kyiv, Ukraine.

### GeoJSON

GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format.

The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types. GeoJSON features need not represent entities of the physical world only; mobile routing and navigation apps, for example, might describe their service coverage using GeoJSON.

The GeoJSON format differs from other GIS standards in that it was written and is maintained not by a formal standards organization, but by an Internet working group of developers.
